# story-viewer-python-Script-
This Python script automates the process of viewing Instagram stories from the followers of a specified celebrity account. It uses Selenium to log in, navigate to the target accountâ€™s follower list, and attempt to view stories. If a user has no story available, the script automatically moves to the next profile.
